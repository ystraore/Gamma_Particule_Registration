## Introduction
This personal machine learning project focuses on the classification of high-energy gamma particles using data generated to simulate the registration of these particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope. The project leverages advanced data processing and machine learning techniques to distinguish between gamma ray-initiated showers and background cosmic ray-initiated showers.

## Project Background
The detection of high-energy gamma particles is facilitated through the observation of Cherenkov radiation, emitted by charged particles within electromagnetic showers initiated by gamma rays in the atmosphere. This radiation, visible to UV wavelengths, is captured by the telescope's detector, forming patterns or "shower images" which can be analyzed to differentiate signal from background noise.

The dataset utilized in this project was generated by the Monte Carlo program Corsika, aimed at simulating extensive air showers and allowing the observation of events with energies down to below 50 GeV.

## Objectives
- To develop a highly accurate classifier for gamma particles using machine learning techniques.
- To explore and implement data preprocessing and machine learning models that enhance the classification accuracy.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Applied principal component analysis (PCA) to define correlation axes and ellipses in shower images, among other preprocessing steps.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Initially utilized Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks, with SVM initially outperforming other models.
- **Model Optimization:** Explored alternative models to address initial performance gaps, significantly increasing accuracy.

## Results
- The initial classifier, engineered with SVM, achieved an accuracy of 86.5%.
- Following model exploration and optimization, a significant accuracy increase to 91% was achieved with the selected alternative models.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For all computational tasks, including data preprocessing and model training.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing SVM and PCA, as well as other machine learning algorithms.
- **NumPy/Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing the data and analysis results.
